# Finding All Similar Motifs

# http://rosalind.info/problems/KSIM/
# 
# Given: A positive integer k (k <=q 50), a DNA
#  string s of length at most 5 kbp representing
#  a motif, and a DNA string t of length at most
#  50 kbp representing a genome.
# 
# Return: All substrings t' of t such that the edit
#  distance d_((E))(s, t') is less than or equal
#  to k.  Each substring should be encoded by a
#  pair containing its location in t followed by
#  its length.
