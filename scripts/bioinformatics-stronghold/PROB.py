# 
# Given: A DNA string s of length at most 100 bp
#  and an array A containing at most 20 numbers
#  between 0 and 1.
# 
# Return: An array B having the same length as A
#  in which B[k] represents the common logarithm
#  of the probability that a random string constructed
#  with the GC-content found in A[k] will match
#  s exactly.
