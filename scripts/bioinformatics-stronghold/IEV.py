# http://rosalind.info/problems/IEV/
# 
# Given: Six nonnegative integers, each of which
#  does not exceed 20,000. The integers correspond
#  to the number of couples in a population possessing
#  each genotype pairing for a given factor. In
#  order, the six given integers represent the number
#  of couples having the following genotypes:
# 
# Return: The expected number of offspring displaying
#  the dominant phenotype in the next generation,
#  under the assumption that every couple has exactly
#  two offspring.
