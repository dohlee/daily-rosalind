# Inferring mRNA from Protein
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/MRNA/
# 
# Given: A protein string of length at most 1000 aa.
# 
# Return: The total number of different RNA strings
#  from which the protein could have been translated,
#  modulo 1,000,000. (Don't neglect the importance
#  of the stop codon in protein translation.)
