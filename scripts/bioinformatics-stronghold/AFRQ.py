# 
# Given: An array A for which A[k] represents the
#  proportion of homozygous recessive individuals
#  for the k-th Mendelian factor in a diploid population.
#  Assume that the population is in genetic equilibrium
#  for all factors.
# 
# Return: An array B having the same length as A
#  in which B[k] represents the probability that
#  a randomly selected individual carries at least
#  one copy of the recessive allele for the k-th
#  factor.
