# Given: A collection of up to 1000 reads of equal

#  of these reads were generated with a single-nucleotide
#  error. For each read s in the dataset, one of
#  the following applies:
# 
# Return: A list of all corrections in the form
#  "[old read]->[new read]".  (Each correction must
#  be a single symbol substitution, and you may
#  return the corrections in any order.)
