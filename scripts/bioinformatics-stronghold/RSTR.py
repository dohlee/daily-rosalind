# Matching Random Motifs

# http://rosalind.info/problems/RSTR/
# 
# Given: A positive integer N <=q 100000, a number
#  x between 0 and 1, and a DNA string s of length
#  at most 10 bp.
# 
# Return: The probability that if N random DNA strings
#  having the same length as s are constructed with
#  GC-content x (see Introduction to Random Strings),
#  then at least one of the strings equals s. We
#  allow for the same random string to be created
#  more than once.
