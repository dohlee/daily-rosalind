# The Founder Effect and Genetic Drift

# 
# Given: Two positive integers N and m, followed
#  by an array A containing k integers between 0
#  and 2N. A[j] represents the number of recessive
#  alleles for the j-th factor in a population of
#  N diploid individuals.
# 
# Return: An m \times k matrix B for which B_(i,
#  j) represents the common logarithm of the probability
#  that after i generations, no copies of the recessive
#  allele for the j-th factor will remain in the
#  population. Apply the Wright-Fisher model.
