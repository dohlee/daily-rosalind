# Overlap Alignment
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/OAP/
# 
# Given: Two DNA strings s and t in FASTA format,
#  each having length at most 10 kbp.
# 
# Return: The score of an optimal overlap alignment
#  of s and t, followed by an alignment of a suffix
#  s' of s and a prefix t' of t achieving this optimal
#  score. Use an alignment score in which matching
#  symbols count +1, substitutions count -2, and
#  there is a linear gap penalty of 2.  If multiple
#  optimal alignments exist, then you may return
#  any one.
