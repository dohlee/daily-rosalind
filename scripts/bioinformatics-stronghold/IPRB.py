# Mendel's First Law
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/IPRB/
# 
# Given: Three positive integers k, m, and n, representing
#  a population containing k+m+n organisms: k individuals
#  are homozygous dominant for a factor, m are heterozygous,
#  and n are homozygous recessive.
# 
# Return: The probability that two randomly selected
#  mating organisms will produce an individual possessing
#  a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant
#  phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can
#  mate.
