# Wright-Fisher's Expected Behavior
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/EBIN/
# 
# Given: A positive integer n (n <=q 1000000) followed
#  by an array P of length m (m <=q 20) containing
#  numbers between 0 and 1.  Each element of P can
#  be seen as representing a probability corresponding
#  to an allele frequency.
# 
# Return: An array B of length m for which B[k]
#  is the expected value of (Bin)(n, P[k]); in terms
#  of Wright-Fisher, it represents the expected
#  allele frequency of the next generation.
