# Find a Highest-Scoring Multiple Sequence Alignment
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA5M/
# 
# Given: Three DNA strings.
# 
# Return: The maximum score of a multiple alignment
#  of these three strings, followed by a multiple
#  alignment of the three strings achieving this
#  maximum. Use a scoring function in which the
#  score of an alignment column is 1 if all three
#  symbols are identical and 0 otherwise. (If more
#  than one multiple alignment achieve the maximum,
#  you may return any one.)
