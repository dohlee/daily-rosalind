# Compute the Probability of a String Emitted by an HMM
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA10D/
# 
# Given: A string x, followed by the alphabet 
#  from which x was constructed, followed by the
#  states States, transition matrix Transition,
#  and emission matrix Emission of an HMM (, States,
#  Transition, Emission).
# 
# Return: The probability Pr(x) that the HMM emits
#  x.
