# Construct a Trie from a Collection of Patterns
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA9A/
# 
# Given: A collection of strings Patterns.
# 
# Return: The adjacency list corresponding to Trie(Patterns),
#  in the following format. If Trie(Patterns) has
#  n nodes, first label the root with 1 and then
#  label the remaining nodes with the integers 2
#  through n in any order you like. Each edge of
#  the adjacency list of Trie(Patterns) will be
#  encoded by a triple: the first two members of
#  the triple must be the integers labeling the
#  initial and terminal nodes of the edge, respectively;
#  the third member of the triple must be the symbol
#  labeling the edge.
