# Implement the Soft k-Means Clustering Algorithm
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA8D/
# 
# Given:  Integers k and m, followed by a stiffness
#  parameter , followed by a set of points Data
#  in m-dimensional space.  
# 
# Return:  A set Centers consisting of k points
#  (centers) resulting from applying the soft k-means
#  clustering algorithm. Select the first k points
#  from Data as the first centers for the algorithm
#  and run the algorithm for 100 steps. Results
#  should be accurate up to three decimal places.
