# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA10J/
# 
# Given: A string x, followed by the alphabet 
#  from which x was constructed, followed by the
#  states States, transition matrix Transition,
#  and emission matrix Emission of an HMM (, States,
#  Transition, Emission).
# 
# Return: The probability Pr(i = k|x) that the
#  HMM was in state k at step i (for each state
#  k and each step i).
