# Find a Highest-Scoring Fitting Alignment of Two Strings
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA5H/
# 
# Given: Two DNA strings v and w, where v has length
#  at most 10000 and w has length at most 1000.
# 
# Return: The maximum score of a fitting alignment
#  of v and w, followed by a fitting alignment achieving
#  this maximum score. Use the simple scoring method
#  in which matches count +1 and both the mismatch
#  and indel penalties are equal to 1. (If multiple
#  fitting alignments achieving the maximum score
#  exist, you may return any one.)
