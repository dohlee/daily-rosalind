# 
# Given: An integer n followed by an adjacency list
#  for a rooted binary tree with n leaves labeled
#  by DNA strings.
# 
# Return: The minimum parsimony score of this tree,
#  followed by the adjacency list of the tree corresponding
#  to labeling internal nodes by DNA strings in
#  order to minimize the parsimony score of the
#  tree.
