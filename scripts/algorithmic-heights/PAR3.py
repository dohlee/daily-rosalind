# 
# Given: A positive integer n <= 10^5 and an array
#  A[1..n] of integers from -10^5 to 10^5.
# 
# Return: An array B[1..n] such that it is a permutation
#  of A and there are indices 1 <= q <= r <= n such
#  that B[i] < A[1] for all 1 <= i <= q-1, B[i]=A[1]
#  for all q <= i <= r, and B[i] > A[1] for all
#  r+1 <= i <= n.
