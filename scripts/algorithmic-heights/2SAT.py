# 2-Satisfiability
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/2SAT/
# 
# Given: A positive integer k <= 20 and k 2SAT formulas
#  represented as follows. The first line gives
#  the number of variables n <= 10^3 and the number
#  of clauses m <= 10^4, each of the following m
#  lines gives a clause of length 2 by specifying
#   two different literals: e.g., a clause (x_3
#  \lor \overline(x)_5) is given by 3 -5.
# 
# Return: For each formula, output 0 if it cannot
#  be satisfied or 1 followed by a satisfying assignment
#  otherwise.
