# Genome Assembly Using Reads
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/GASM/
# 
# Given: A collection S of (error-free) reads of
#  equal length (not exceeding 50 bp). In this dataset,
#  for some positive integer k, the de Bruijn graph
#  B_k on S_(k+1) \cup S_(k+1)^(\textrm(rc)) consists
#  of exactly two directed cycles.
# 
# Return: A cyclic superstring of minimal length
#  containing every read or its reverse complement.
