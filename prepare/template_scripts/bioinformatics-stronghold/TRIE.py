# Introduction to Pattern Matching
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/TRIE/
# 
# Given: A list of at most 100 DNA strings of length
#  at most 100 bp, none of which is a prefix of
#  another.
# 
# Return: The adjacency list corresponding to the
#  trie T for these patterns, in the following format.
#  If T has n nodes, first label the root with 1
#  and then label the remaining nodes with the integers
#  2 through n in any order you like.  Each edge
#  of the adjacency list of T will be encoded by
#  a triple containing the integer representing
#  the edge's parent node, followed by the integer
#  representing the edge's child node, and finally
#  the symbol labeling the edge.
