# Alignment-Based Phylogeny

# http://rosalind.info/problems/ALPH/
# 
# Given: A rooted binary tree T on n (n <=q 500)
#  species, given in Newick format, followed by
#  a multiple alignment of m (m <=q n) augmented
#  DNA strings having the same length (at most 300
#  bp) corresponding to the species and given in
#  FASTA format.
# 
# Return: The minimum possible value of d_(\textrm(H))(T),
#  followed by a collection of DNA strings to be
#  assigned to the internal nodes of T that will
#  minimize d_(\textrm(H))(T) (multiple solutions
#  will exist, but you need only output one).
