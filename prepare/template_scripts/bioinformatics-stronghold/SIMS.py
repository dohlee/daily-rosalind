# Finding a Motif with Modifications
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/SIMS/
# 
# Given: Two DNA strings s and t, where s has length
#  at most 10 kbp and t represents a motif of length
#  at most 1 kbp.
# 
# Return: An optimal fitting alignment score with
#  respect to the mismatch score defined above,
#  followed by an optimal fitting alignment of a
#  substring of s against t. If multiple such alignments
#  exist, then you may output any one.
