# 
# Given: A positive integer n (n <=q 1,000,000),
#  a DNA string s of even length at most 10, and
#  an array A of length at most 20, containing numbers
#  between 0 and 1.
# 
# Return:  An array B having the same length as
#  A in which B[i] represents the expected number
#  of times that s will appear as a substring of
#  a random DNA string t of length n, where t is
#  formed with GC-content A[i] (see Introduction
#  to Random Strings).
