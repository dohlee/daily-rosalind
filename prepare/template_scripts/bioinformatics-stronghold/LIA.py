# Given: Two positive integers k (k <=q 7) and N
#  (N <=q 2^k).  In this problem, we begin with
#  Tom, who in the 0th generation has genotype Aa
#  Bb.  Tom has two children in the 1st generation,
#  each of whom has two children, and so on. Each
#  organism always mates with an organism having
#  genotype Aa Bb.
# 
# Return: The probability that at least N Aa Bb
#  organisms will belong to the k-th generation
#  of Tom's family tree (don't count the Aa Bb mates
#  at each level).  Assume that Mendel's second
#  law holds for the factors.
