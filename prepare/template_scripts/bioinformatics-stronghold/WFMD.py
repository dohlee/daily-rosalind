# The Wright-Fisher Model of Genetic Drift
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/WFMD/
# 
# Given: Positive integers N (N <=q 7), m (m <=q
#  2N), g (g <=q 6) and k (k <=q 2N).
# 
# Return: The probability that in a population of
#  N diploid individuals initially possessing m
#  copies of a dominant allele, we will observe
#  after g generations at least k copies of a recessive
#  allele. Assume the Wright-Fisher model.
