#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/MEND/
# 
# Given: A rooted binary tree T in Newick format
#  encoding an individual's pedigree for a Mendelian
#  factor whose alleles are A (dominant) and a (recessive).
# 
# Return: Three numbers between 0 and 1, corresponding
#  to the respective probabilities that the individual
#  at the root of T will exhibit the "AA", "Aa"
#  and "aa" genotypes.
