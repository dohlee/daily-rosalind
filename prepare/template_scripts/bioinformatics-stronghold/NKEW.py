# http://rosalind.info/problems/NKEW/
# 
# Given: A collection of n weighted trees (n <=q
#  40) in Newick format, with each tree containing
#  at most 200 nodes; each tree T_k is followed
#  by a pair of nodes x_k and y_k in T_k.
# 
# Return: A collection of n numbers, for which the
#  kth number represents the distance between x_k
#  and y_k in T_k.
