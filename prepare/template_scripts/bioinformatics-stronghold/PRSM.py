# Matching a Spectrum to a Protein
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/PRSM/
# 
# Given: A positive integer n followed by a collection
#  of n protein strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_n and a
#  multiset R of positive numbers (corresponding
#  to the complete spectrum of some unknown protein
#  string).
# 
# Return: The maximum multiplicity of R \ominus
#  S[s_k] taken over all strings s_k, followed by
#  the string s_k for which this maximum multiplicity
#  occurs (you may output any such value if multiple
#  solutions exist).
