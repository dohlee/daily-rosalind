# Inferring Peptide from Full Spectrum
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/FULL/
# 
# Given: A list L containing 2n + 3 positive real
#  numbers (n <=q 100). The first number in L is
#  the parent mass of a peptide P, and all other
#  numbers represent the masses of some b-ions and
#  y-ions of P (in no particular order). You may
#  assume that if the mass of a b-ion is present,
#  then so is that of its complementary y-ion, and
#  vice-versa.
# 
# Return: A protein string t of length n for which
#  there exist two positive real numbers w_1 and
#  w_2 such that for every prefix p and suffix s
#  of t, each of w(p) + w_1 and w(s) + w_2 is equal
#  to an element of L.  (In other words, there exists
#  a protein string whose t-prefix and t-suffix
#  weights correspond to the non-parent mass values
#  of L.)  If multiple solutions exist, you may
#  output any one.
