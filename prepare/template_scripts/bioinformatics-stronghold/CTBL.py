# Creating a Character Table
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/CTBL/
# 
# Given: An unrooted binary tree T in Newick format
#  for at most 200 species taxa.
# 
# Return: A character table having the same splits
#  as the edge splits of T. The columns of the character
#  table should encode the taxa ordered lexicographically;
#  the rows of the character table may be given
#  in any order.  Also, for any given character,
#  the particular subset of taxa to which 1s are
#  assigned is arbitrary.
