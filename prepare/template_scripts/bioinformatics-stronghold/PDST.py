# Creating a Distance Matrix
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/PDST/
# 
# Given: A collection of n (n <=q 10) DNA strings
#  s_1, ..., s_n of equal length (at most 1 kbp).
#  Strings are given in FASTA format.
# 
# Return: The matrix D corresponding to the p-distance
#  d_p on the given strings.  As always, note that
#  your answer is allowed an absolute error of 0.001.
