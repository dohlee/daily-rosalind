# Semiglobal Alignment
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/SMGB/
# 
# Given: Two DNA strings s and t in FASTA format,
#  each having length at most 10 kbp.
# 
# Return: The maximum semiglobal alignment score
#  of s and t, followed by an alignment of s and
#  t achieving this maximum score.  Use an alignment
#  score in which matching symbols count +1, substitutions
#  count -1, and there is a linear gap penalty of
#  1. If multiple optimal alignments exist, then
#  you may return any one.
