# Identifying Reversing Substitutions

# 
# Given: A rooted binary tree T with labeled nodes
#  in Newick format, followed by a collection of
#  at most 100 DNA strings in FASTA format whose
#  labels correspond to the labels of T. We will
#  assume that the DNA strings have the same length,
#  which does not exceed 400 bp).
# 
# Return: A list of all reversing substitutions
#  in T (in any order), with each substitution encoded
#  by the following three items:
