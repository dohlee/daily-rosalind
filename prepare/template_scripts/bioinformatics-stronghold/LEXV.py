# Ordering Strings of Varying Length Lexicographically
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/LEXV/
# 
# Given: A permutation of at most 12 symbols defining
#  an ordered alphabet (A) and a positive integer
#  n (n <=q 4).
# 
# Return: All strings of length at most n formed
#  from (A), ordered lexicographically. (Note: As
#  in Enumerating k-mers Lexicographically, alphabet
#  order is based on the order in which the symbols
#  are given.)
