# Given: Two DNA strings s and t in FASTA format
#  that share some short inexact repeat r of 32-40
#  bp. By "inexact" we mean that r may appear with
#  slight modifications (each repeat differ by <=q3
#  changes/indels).
# 
# Return: The total number of occurrences of r as
#  a substring of s, followed by the total number
#  of occurrences of r as a substring of t.
