# 
# Given: A positive integer n <= 10^5 and an array
#  A[1..n] of integers from -10^5 to 10^5.
# 
# Return: A permuted array B[1..n] such that it
#  is a permutation of A and there is an index 1
#  <= q <= n such that B[i] <= A[1] for all 1 <=
#  i <= q-1, B[q]=A[1], and B[i] > A[1] for all
#  q+1 <= i <= n.
