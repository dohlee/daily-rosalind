# Dijkstra's Algorithm
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/DIJ/
# 
# Given: A simple directed graph with positive edge
#  weights from 1 to 10^3 and n <= 10^3 vertices
#  in the edge list format.
# 
# Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the length
#  of a shortest path from the vertex 1 to the vertex
#  i (D[1]=0). If i is not reachable from 1 set
#  D[i] to -1.
