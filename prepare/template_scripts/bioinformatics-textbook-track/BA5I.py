# Find a Highest-Scoring Overlap Alignment of Two Strings
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA5I/
# 
# Given: Two protein strings v and w, each of length
#  at most 1000.
# 
# Return: The score of an optimal overlap alignment
#  of v and w, followed by an alignment of a suffix
#  v of v and a prefix w of w achieving this maximum
#  score. Use an alignment score in which matches
#  count +1 and both the mismatch and indel penalties
#  are 2. (If multiple overlap alignments achieving
#  the maximum score exist, you may return any one.)
