# Compute Limb Lengths in a Tree
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA7B/
# 
# Given: An integer n, followed by an integer j
#  between 0 and n - 1, followed by a space-separated
#  additive distance matrix D (whose elements are
#  integers).
# 
# Return: The limb length of the leaf in Tree(D)
#  corresponding to row j of this distance matrix
#  (use 0-based indexing).
