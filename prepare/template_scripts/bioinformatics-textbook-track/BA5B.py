#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA5B/
# 
# Given: Integers n and m, followed by an n  (m+1)
#  matrix Down and an (n+1)  m matrix Right. The
#  two matrices are separated by the "-" symbol.
# 
# Return: The length of a longest path from source
#  (0, 0) to sink (n, m) in the n  m rectangular
#  grid whose edges are defined by the matrices
#  Down and Right.
