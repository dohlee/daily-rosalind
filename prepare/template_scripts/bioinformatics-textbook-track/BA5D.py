# Find the Longest Path in a DAG
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA5D/
# 
# Given: An integer representing the source node
#  of a graph, followed by an integer representing
#  the sink node of the graph, followed by an edge-weighted
#  graph. The graph is represented by a modified
#  adjacency list in which the notation "0->1:7"
#  indicates that an edge connects node 0 to node
#  1 with weight 7.
# 
# Return: The length of a longest path in the graph,
#  followed by a longest path. (If multiple longest
#  paths exist, you may return any one.)
