# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA8C/
# 
# Given: Integers k and m followed by a set of points
#  Data in m-dimensional space.  
# 
# Return: A set Centers consisting of k points (centers)
#  resulting from applying the Lloyd algorithm to
#  Data and Centers, where the first k points from
#  Data are selected as the first k centers.
