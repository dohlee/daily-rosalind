# Implement the Neighbor Joining Algorithm
#
# http://rosalind.info/problems/BA7E/
# 
# Given: An integer n, followed by a space-separated
#  n x n distance matrix.
# 
# Return: An adjacency list for the tree resulting
#  from applying the neighbor-joining algorithm.
#  Edge-weights should be accurate to two decimal
#  places (they are provided to three decimal places
#  in the sample output below).
