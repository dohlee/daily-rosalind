# 
# Given: An integer M, an integer N, and a collection
#  of (possibly repeated) integers Spectrum.
# 
# Return: A cyclic peptide LeaderPeptide with amino
#  acids taken only from the top M elements (and
#  ties) of the convolution of Spectrum that fall
#  between 57 and 200, and where the size of Leaderboard
#  is restricted to the top N (and ties).
